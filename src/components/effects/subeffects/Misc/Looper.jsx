    <h1>Looper</h1>
    <p>As the name implies, a looper records a guitar's input and loops it until switched off. One of the first people to develop a mechanism to do this with tapes was virtuoso and genius Les Paul.
      In the last quarter of the 20th century, tape looping, eventually evolving into digital looping and sampling became a keystone for Hip Hop and electronic music.
      Looping is a great way to build up a one man band, or to add depth to an ensemble. Some looping pedals such as the Ditto X2 and the Line 6 DL4 can run octave, speed, and reverse effects on the loops.
