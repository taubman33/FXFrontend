    <h1>BitCrusher</h1>
    <p>A relatively modern effect that emerged with the advent of digital recording and guitar synthesis in the late 20th century, Bit Crushing is an effect that takes the instrument's sound, converts it into an analog signal, and through novel ways such as reducing sample rate or cutting out specific frequencies of the EQ, creates a dirty, lo-fi sound with tones that range from an old transistor radio, to a computer slowly dying,
        While this effect is not commonly found in classic rock and more traditional genres, it is a powerful way to change the guitar's signal into something wholly unnatural.
