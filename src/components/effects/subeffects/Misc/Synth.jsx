<h1>Synthesizer</h1>
<p>Ever since Brian Wilson added a Theramin to the Beach Boys' classic Good Vibrations, musicians have been looking for new and innovative ways to create sound.
   With the advent of the Synthesizer in the late 20th century, entirely new worlds of tonal shaping are possible. There are some pedals available that can create some truly unique sounds, though some guitar players prefer to plug their guitar straight into a synthesizer!
