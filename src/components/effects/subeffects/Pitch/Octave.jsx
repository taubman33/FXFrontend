   <h1>Octave</h1>

  <p>As the name would suggest, an octave effect duplicates the guitar's signal sending it up or down (or both!) an octave. 
      One of the earliest instances of this effect being done was George Martin famously doubling the tempo of a piano part to mock a Harmonium style sound in The Beatles "In My Life." 
      Frank Zappa would do the opposite, cutting the tape-speed of his vocals down to give a low, deep sound to his voice.
