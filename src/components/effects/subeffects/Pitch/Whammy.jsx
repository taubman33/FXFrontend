   <h1>Wah Wah
   </h1>

  <p>Instantly recognizable and one of the most iconic sounds of the electric guitar, the Wah pedal was first developed in the mid 1960's as notch filter that could be adjusted in real time via a wobbling foot controller.
    The effect gained popularity when Hendrix used it to turn his guitar into a percussion instrument in the beginning of Voodoo Chile, and the effect became a signature of Funk, R&B, and Soul music in the 1970's.
