<h1>Flanger</h1>
<p>Flanging is an effect characterized by the distinctive and instantly recongizable "Woosh"-ing sound, resulting from a change in the delay time of the modulated signal. This is different than the Chorus effect, where the time remains unchanged.
  The effect was originally seen as a problem that would result from varying speeds of recording tape reels in pre 1960's recording, it quickly became a popular effect after The Beatles used it on the famous song Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds, manually created by altering the tape speed by hand.
  It has since become almost synomomous with psychedlic rock, and was used commonly to give more character to guitar solos in the 1980's.
