<h1>Vibrato</h1>

<p>The Vibrato effect is very similar to Tremolo, but with some differences. While Tremolo affects the signal's volume, causing a percieved change in the pitch of the tone, Vibrato affects the pitch of the signal, which is percieved as a volume change to the listener.
  Ironically enough, the classic 60's Fender amps mistakenly labeled their Tremolo effect as Vibrato, leading to a confusion between the two effects.
