<h1>Phaser</h1>

<p> In a phased signal, one part of the signal stays the same and the other part gets a phase shift of varying depth. The two signals are mixed back together at the output and the differences between the two create the legendary phaser effect.
    This can produce a very dynamic effect with a lot of variety of tone. Eddie Van Halen famously used his phaser on the lowest setting during solos to add some character to the tone, and give the top end a slight boost, 
    while funk masters Eddie Hazel and Ernie Eisley would drench their signal with the effect, giving that famous Funky sound that phasers are known for.
