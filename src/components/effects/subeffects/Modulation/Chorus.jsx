<h1>Chorus</h1>

<p>A chorus effect occurs when individual sounds with approximately the same time, and very similar pitches, converge and are perceived as one.
the processor achieves the effect by taking an audio signal and mixing it with one or more delayed, pitch-modulated copies of itself. The pitch of the added voices is typically modulated by an LFO, which makes the overall effect similar to that of a flanger, except with longer delays and without feedback.
