  <h1>Delay</h1>

  <p>Delay is a widely used effect that is analogous to echo but with some slight differences. 
    While the repeats of an Echo effect decrease in volume with each repeat, mimicing the natural echo of a canyon or tunnel, a proper Delay effect can keep the repeats with the same volume and tone. This allows a delay effect to repeat for a longer time than a similarly used Echo effect.
    Also, Echo is primarily an analog/tape based effect, Delay can use digital circuits as well. There are a number of modern delay pedals that can do all kinds of strange effects to the repeated signal, such as reversing it, adding modulation it, or adding octave and shimmer effects.
