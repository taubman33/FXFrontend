  <h1>Echo</h1>

  <p> Originally created by the genius guitarist Les Paul by manipulating tape in a Reel to Reel machine, the Echo effect really took off in the 1960's, with the advent of the Binson EchoRec, a devise still feted for its warm sound and long repeats.
    Echo is a widely used effect that is analogous to Delay but with some slight differences. 
    While the repeats of a digital delay can maintain their volume and tone over their course, the repeats of an echo will tend to fade out as they go, matching the natural sound of an echo.
    Echo effects can be done through either digital or analog circuitry, with characteristics specific to each. Many players eschew the modern digital sound and spend extra to get that vintage crackling tape sound that makes classic echo sound so good.
