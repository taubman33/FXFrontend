  <h1>Reverb</h1>

  <p>Musicians use many ways to replicate the sound of playing in a great cathedral or hall, to get that full, large sound we call Reverb, after the Reverberation of the sounds off of the surfaces.
      Reverb as an effect was developed by Les Paul, and since its inception has had many forms and variations. Spring reverb, which comes from the reverberations of a metal spring within an amplifier is a famous characteristic of 50's Surf Rock. In the 60's and 70's, producers used large metal plates to create the thich reverb that would be characteristic of Phil Spector's "Wall of Sound" recordings.
      In the 1980's the use of a Gated Reverb, which would cut out when reaching a certain low db level, was widely used, and is easily recognized on songs like Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight".
      Most songs will have some element of reverb on them, either on the drums, vocals, or the track as a whole. Even live recorded songs have reverb on them, though that comes mostly from the space the recording is in more than any electronic devise.
