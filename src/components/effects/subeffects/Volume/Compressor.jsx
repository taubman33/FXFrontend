  <h1>Compression</h1>

  <p> First used to better the sound quality AM radio, compressors are an essential part of any audio engineer's arsenal. 
    A compressor takes the electric signal and 'squashes' it down, so all of the levels across the audio spectrum are equal.
    This is useful not only when trying to get a stronger tone in a song, but also to control volume and tone levels when switching between instruments in a live set.
    While compressor pedals are very popular, and have a wide range of features and functions, they are not nearly as powerful as the classic tube-based compressors used in radio broadcasting, or in the compressor plug ins that are featured on all digital audio software like ProTools or Ableton.
    Most songs feature some element of compression, but it is the type of effect that sounds best when it is used subtly.
