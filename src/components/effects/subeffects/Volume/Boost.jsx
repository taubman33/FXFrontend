  <p> Clean boosts, as the name implies, give your guitar signal a slight volume boost without effecting the tone the way a Compressor would, or pushing the signal into Overdrive the way a Tubescreamer or Centaur would.
      It is hard to find any recorded songs that feature a Boost pedal on them because of their nature, but check out the pedal board of any arena rock lead guitarist and you will be sure to find a clean boost there to give them the juice they need for solos and leads.
