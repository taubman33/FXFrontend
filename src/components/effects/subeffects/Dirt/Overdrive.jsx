<h1>Overdrive </h1>

<p>Perhaps the definitive sound of the electric guitar, Overdrive comes from pushing a guitar's signal so strong that the amplifier begins to clip its signal, resulting in a full, harmonically saturated tone that can pack a bite.
  The effect was famously done by Chicago Blues greats Buddy Guy and Hubert Sumlin in the 1950's, but it was not fashionable until their sounds were copied by guitarists of the 1960's, such as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page. 
  It is Clapton's famous tone on the John Mayall "Beano" album that shifted the paradigm of guitar away from overly clean into the world of overdrive. And when Hendrix turned it up even more in Purple Haze, the world of guitar tone changed forever.
  At this point, it is far more difficult to find songs with fully clean guitar parts than listing ones that have some form of overdrive on them.
