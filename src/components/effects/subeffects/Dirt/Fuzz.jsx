<h1> Fuzz</h1>

<p> An iconic effect of garage rock and heavy metal, Fuzz is the most intense form of overdrive, where the signal is pushed hard enough that the amplifier begins clipping the sound. This results in the harsh, biting Fuzz tone that guitarists from Hendrix to Jack White have been lusting after for decades.
    Keith Richards popularized this effect in the introduction to their famous song "Satisfaction" as an attempt to copy the sound of a horn section. 
    Since then it has been a favorite of many guitar players, experiencing a revival in the Garage Rock scene of the 2000's.
