            <h1> Distortion</h1>

            <p> Arguably the most commonly used effect in Rock music, distortion takes the effect of overdrive and pushes it further, causing the sonic waveform to distort from a sine wave into a triangle or sawtooth shape.
                The sound was originally created by cranking up an amplifier to the point of clipping, or physically damaging the amplifier's speakers, famously done by the Kinks in their mid-60's singles, there are now a myriad of pedals to recreate this effect without having to damage your gear.
                In fact, the release of Boss's DS distortion pedal series, probably the highest selling and most popular of all effect pedals out there, can be considered as the beginning of the modern era of Effect Pedals.
                Used to either give a little bit of bite to a rhythm track, or boost up a solo and give it a strong bite, it is far more difficult to find Rock songs that do not have any distortion that finding those that do!
